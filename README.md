# Reverse Engineering Android Malware ü§ñ

During this talk, I introduce the flow of malware analysis from the discovery to the reverse engineering phase. I show how to reverse engineer malicious Android applications and even look at a case study of the notorious SpyNote malware. Together we locate the malicious C2 server hidden inside of the Android application's resources.

## Bonus Challenge üîç

Can you find the malicious C2 server inside this similar SpyNote sample?
